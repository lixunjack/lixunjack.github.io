   <h2>What Thousands of Induced Earthquakes Taught Us about Hydraulic Diffusivity and Aseismic Slip at the UK Geothermal Test Site (Rosemanowes, Cornwall).</h2>

  In the early 1980s, engineers drilled into hot granite beneath a Cornish quarry and began pumping in water at high pressure. 
  The idea was simple and bold: turn “hot dry rock” into a man‑made geothermal reservoir. As the water forced its way through the 
  rock, the subsurface cracked, creaked, and slipped—sometimes loudly enough to register as tiny earthquakes, and sometimes in 
  complete silence.
</p>

<p>
  Decades later, we went back to this classic experiment at <em>Rosemanowes</em> with fresh eyes and modern analysis tools. We studied 
  5,184 microearthquakes triggered during the main stimulation phase, most of which are far too small to be felt by humans at the surface, but rich with 
  information about how the rock responded to injection. By comparing how much the rock deformed overall with how much of that 
  deformation showed up as seismic shaking, we could ask a simple but fundamental question:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>When we inject fluid into the subsurface, how much of the resulting deformation becomes earthquakes—and how much 
  slips by quietly, without a sound?</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The answer at Rosemanowes was striking. Only a tiny fraction of the injected strain was released seismically; most of the 
  deformation was effectively silent. At the same time, the expanding “cloud” of event locations revealed that the reservoir was 
  far from uniform. Seismicity spread much more easily up and down than sideways, pointing to a strongly anisotropic 
  (direction‑dependent) flow field with exceptionally high vertical permeability. Our research draws a solid picture that fluid exploits 
  pre‑existing fractures: some slipping in shear and radiating seismic waves, many more opening and creeping aseismically to form 
  efficient vertical pathways for flow.

  <h3>1) Site and Geological Background</h3>

  <p>
    The Rosemanowes geothermal test site sits in a granite quarry on the Carnmenellis pluton in southwest England, a short drive
    from Falmouth in Cornwall. At the surface it looks fairly ordinary – a worked quarry face, heathland, farm tracks – but
    beneath it lies one of the UK’s best‑characterised blocks of hot crystalline rock. This made Rosemanowes an ideal natural
    laboratory for “hot dry rock” (HDR) geothermal research in the late 1970s and 1980s.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Carnmenellis granite is part of the Cornubian batholith, a chain of granitic bodies stretching from Dartmoor in Devon
    all the way to the Isles of Scilly (Exley &amp; Stone, 1964; Searle et al., 2024). Gravity surveys indicate that the granite
    beneath Rosemanowes extends to at least 10 km depth (Bott et al., 1958), forming a thick, relatively homogeneous block of
    low‑porosity, low‑permeability rock. Thermal measurements showed a favourable geothermal gradient: at depths of 2–3 km the
    rock temperature exceeds 80–100 °C, warm enough to be interesting for heat extraction but still technically drillable with
    conventional rigs for the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crucially, the granite is <em>tight</em>: it contains very little connected pore space. Fluids don’t flow easily through the
    intact matrix. Instead, most permeability comes from natural fractures and joints – planes of weakness formed during the
    granite’s cooling and its long subsequent tectonic history. Borehole image logs at Rosemanowes revealed two main sets of
    steeply dipping joints: one trending roughly NW–SE (often called Set 1), and another roughly NE–SW (Set 2; Baria et al.,
    1984b, 1984e). These pre‑existing joint sets would later prove central to understanding how the injected fluid moved and how
    the induced seismicity was organised.
  </p>

  <p>
    The regional stress field in southwest England is also relatively well constrained from hydraulic tests and mining data.
    At Rosemanowes, the maximum horizontal compressive stress (σ<sub>H</sub>) trends approximately NW–SE and exceeds the minimum
    horizontal stress (σ<sub>h</sub>) by several tens of megapascals at ~2 km depth (Baria et al., 1983). This means that some
    of the subvertical joints are already close to failure in shear: a modest increase in pore pressure along those planes can
    effectively “unclamp” them and trigger slip. From a geomechanics perspective, Rosemanowes offers a relatively simple but
    informative configuration: a thick, stiff granite body, a well‑defined ambient stress field, and a known fracture network.
  </p>

  <p>
    The HDR concept tested here was to turn this otherwise impermeable hot rock into a useable geothermal reservoir by
    engineering a connected fracture system at depth. The programme drilled at least two deep wells into the granite:
    RH12, an inclined injection well reaching ~2 km, and RH11, a production well used to recover a fraction of the injected
    water (Baria et al., 1984a). Rather than relying on explosive stimulation, the operators injected water at elevated
    pressures to encourage slip and opening along existing fractures and to enhance connectivity between them. Over time, they
    alternated between high‑rate “stimulation” periods and lower‑rate circulation phases, during which water was pumped from
    RH12, flowed through the stimulated fracture network, and was recovered at RH11.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most innovative aspects of the Rosemanowes project was its microseismic monitoring. In the early 1980s it was
    far from standard practice to run dense downhole seismic arrays and systematically catalogue thousands of microearthquakes.
    At Rosemanowes, a network of vertical‑component and three‑component accelerometers was cemented in shallow boreholes, up to
    ~300 m deep, directly into the granite host rock (Baria et al., 1984c). These were complemented by calibration shots and
    vertical seismic profiling (VSP) surveys to refine the local velocity model (Baria et al., 1984d). Because the reservoir
    sits within a relatively uniform granitic block that outcrops at the surface, ray paths from microearthquakes to the
    sensors traverse mainly granite, allowing a comparatively simple half‑space velocity model with station delays to be used.
  </p>

  <p>
    This careful experimental design paid off. During the main creation and development phase of the reservoir (Phase 2A),
    the network detected and located 5,184 induced microearthquakes, with magnitudes down to about M<sub>w</sub> ≈ −1
    (and smaller, closer events below this threshold). Each event was recorded on multiple downhole stations, enabling
    reasonably precise hypocentre locations and spectral estimates of scalar seismic moment (Andrews, 1986). For the time,
    this was an exceptionally rich induced‑seismicity data set – one that could only later be fully exploited as analysis
    methods matured (e.g. Dinske &amp; Shapiro, 2013; Shapiro, 2015).
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, Rosemanowes combined three things that are rarely available together: a simple geological setting, a well‑controlled
    hydraulic experiment, and a high‑quality microseismic catalogue. That combination makes it an ideal natural laboratory for
    exploring how fluid injection, fracture networks, and induced seismicity interact – and for asking how much of a geothermal
    reservoir’s deformation is noisy, and how much happens in near‑silence.

  <h3>2) Injection and Production with Seismicity Response</h3>

  <p>
    The Rosemanowes experiment was, at heart, a controlled plumbing exercise in very hard rock. Water was pumped down the
    injection well (RH12) and, some of it at least, came back up the production well (RH11). The first figure shows how this
    played out over time: the injected volume (VI) climbs steadily as operators push more water into the granite, while the
    produced volume (VP) lags behind. The gap between those two curves is the <em>net stored volume</em>, VN = VI − VP –– effectively,
    how much extra water is being held somewhere in the subsurface rather than coming back to the surface. What’s striking is
    how large that gap becomes. Even after production starts, the net storage keeps growing, telling us that the reservoir is
    acting as a very compliant sponge: it can take in a lot of water without forcing it all back out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then we track how the tiny earthquakes respond to these operational changes. When injection rates are high, the
    cumulative seismic moment (a measure of total seismic “work” done by all the microearthquakes) rises in steps. During
    “shut‑in” periods, when the production well is closed and flow pauses or changes, seismicity often quietens down – sometimes
    almost completely. The annotations – “stimulation”, “shut‑in”, “aseismic” – help link what the pumps are doing at the
    surface to how the rock is responding at 2 km depth. Most of the time, despite large changes in injected volume, the
    seismic response is surprisingly modest.

  </div>


  <p>
    To make this more quantitative, we compared how fast seismic moment accumulated with how fast net fluid volume was
    increasing, using 30‑hour time windows. This gives us an <em>apparent shear modulus</em>, μ<sub>ap</sub>, and from that a
    <em>strain partition factor</em> η – the fraction of total deformation that shows up as earthquakes. The third figure
    summarises the key result: η is tiny, about 10<sup>−4</sup>, meaning only around 0.01% of the injected strain was released
    seismically. And as injection continued, μ<sub>ap</sub> didn’t stay constant. Instead, it showed a clear step‑like drop once
    the net stored volume reached roughly 70,600 m³. In other words, as the reservoir filled and the fracture system became
    better connected, the rock increasingly accommodated additional deformation <em>silently</em> – through elastic expansion,
    aseismic slip, and crack opening – rather than by generating more microearthquakes. The seismic response actually
    <em>decelerated</em>, even as more and more water was being stored at depth.

  <h3>3) How Seismogenic “Noisy” is the Reservoir?</h3>

  <p>
    Once we know when and where the microearthquakes happened, the next question is: <em>how big</em> were they, and what does that
    say about the state of the reservoir? Seismologists have a simple but powerful way to summarise this, called the
    Gutenberg–Richter law. It says that small earthquakes are much more common than large ones, and that the relationship between
    frequency and size can be captured by a straight line on a log–linear plot. The slope of that line is the famous
    <em>b‑value</em>. For global tectonic earthquakes, b is typically around 1. At Rosemanowes, using thousands of events reliably
    detected down to about M<sub>w</sub> ≈ −1.0, we found a much steeper slope: b ≈ 2.3. In practical terms, this means the
    sequence is heavily dominated by very small events, with relatively few larger ones. Laboratory and field studies link high
    b‑values to low “stress intensity” on the largest fractures: the system is not strongly focused onto one big fault, but rather
    spread across many smaller cracks in a relatively compliant, well‑buffered volume.
  </p>

        The frequency–magnitude curve is steep (b ≈ 2.3), meaning many tiny events and very few larger ones – a statistical
        fingerprint of low stress concentration on the largest fractures.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

  </div>


  <p>
    A high b‑value tells us the <em>shape</em> of the earthquake size distribution, but it doesn’t tell us how “trigger‑happy” the
    reservoir is overall. For that, we use another metric: the <em>seismogenic index</em>, Σ, introduced by Shapiro and colleagues.
    Σ measures how many earthquakes you get per unit of injected fluid volume, for a given magnitude threshold. High Σ means a
    reservoir that responds to injection with lots of seismicity; low Σ means that most of the deformation is taken up silently.
    At Rosemanowes, we tracked how the number of events above various magnitude cut‑offs grows with net injected volume and used
    this to estimate Σ. For a threshold around M<sub>w</sub> ≈ −0.8, we obtained Σ ≈ −4.2 – low compared to many geothermal
    projects worldwide, and much closer to values reported for some unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. This is entirely
    consistent with what we saw in the strain partition analysis: very little of the injected strain shows up as earthquakes,
    and the system’s overall susceptibility to induced seismicity is modest despite substantial fluid volumes.
  </p>

        As net injected volume increases, the number of events above a given magnitude grows slowly. A low Σ ≈ −4.2 indicates
        that Rosemanowes is relatively “quiet” per cubic metre of water injected, with most deformation occurring aseismically.

  <h3>4) How Does the Fluid Really Move? From Simple Diffusion to Channelled Flow</h3>

  <p>
    When you inject water into hot, fractured granite, you might imagine the pressure spreading outwards like dye in a still pond:
    smoothly, symmetrically, and at a predictable rate. In that ideal world, pore pressure relaxes in a uniform, isotropic medium
    and the “activation front” for induced earthquakes – the distance out to which events are triggered – grows like
    r ∝ t<sup>1/2</sup>. This is the classic diffusion picture many models start from.
  </p>


  <div class="figure-grid" style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; width: min(860px, 92vw);">

        rather than simple, uniform diffusion.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

  </div>

  <p>
    At Rosemanowes, the data tell a more interesting story. If we track how far each microearthquake is from the injection point
    and how that distance changes with time, we can sketch an envelope around the expanding cloud of events – the so‑called
    “triggering front”. The first plot below shows these distances as dots, along with a reference curve behaving like
    r ∝ t<sup>1/2</sup>. Early on, many events fall outside this smooth envelope; later, some parts of the cloud seem to stall at
    preferred distances, hinting at specific fractures or zones that keep reactivating. This already suggests that a simple,
    uniform diffusion model is not capturing what the reservoir is actually doing.
  </p>

      <figcaption>
        <strong>Non‑Fickian diffusion</strong><br>
        The mean distance of events grows roughly as r ∝ t<sup>0.382</sup>, significantly slower than the 1/2 exponent expected
        for classical diffusion – consistent with anisotropic channeling of flow through a fracture network dominated by
        vertical pathways.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

  </div>


  <p>
    To go beyond that first look, we averaged event distances in 1‑hour windows and examined how the mean distance grows with
    time on log–log axes. In a purely Fickian (textbook) diffusion process, the slope of that line should be 0.5. Instead, we
    find a slope of about 0.38. This slower‑than‑expected growth is a hallmark of <em>non‑Fickian</em> diffusion: the fluid and
    pressure are not spreading out evenly in all directions, but are being steered and bottlenecked by the fracture network and
    evolving permeability. In other words, the reservoir behaves less like a uniform sponge and more like a network of
    preferential pathways and barriers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can push this idea further by fitting a three‑dimensional surface to the outer edge of the seismic cloud. If the medium
    were isotropic, that surface would be a sphere. Instead, the best fit at Rosemanowes is a stretched ellipsoid: relatively
    short in one horizontal direction, somewhat longer in the perpendicular horizontal direction, and dramatically elongated
    vertically. From this geometry we can back out effective hydraulic diffusivities along the three principal axes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>D<sub>11</sub> ≈ 0.01 m²/s (minor horizontal axis, ~NE)</li>
    <li>D<sub>22</sub> ≈ 0.03 m²/s (intermediate horizontal axis, ~NW)</li>
    <li>D<sub>33</sub> ≈ 1.6 m²/s (major axis, vertical)</li>

<p>
  The above vedio shows the evolution of induced seismicity during Phase 2A at Rosemanowes in three dimensions. Each point marks a
  microseismic event at its recorded hypocentre, coloured by time and scaled by seismic moment. As time progresses, the cloud
  of events expands away from the injection zone, revealing a strongly anisotropic growth pattern. Superimposed on the seismicity cloud is a best‑fit 
  three‑dimensional ellipsoid that tracks the outer boundary of the events
  (the “triggering front”). If the rock mass behaved as a homogeneous isotropic medium, this boundary would be approximately
  spherical. Instead, the fitted surface is markedly elongated in the vertical direction and compressed along one horizontal
  axis, consistent with a homogeneous but anisotropic hydraulic diffusivity tensor in the principal coordinate system:
</p>


<p>
  The vertical component exceeds the horizontal components by almost two orders of magnitude, implying that once stimulation
  begins the reservoir either develops or reactivates an extremely efficient vertical fluid conduit. Pressure and fluid diffuse
  up and down much more readily than laterally, and the triggering front inherits this strong anisotropy. Together with the
  statistical and structural analyses presented elsewhere, this supports a picture of injection fluid exploiting a pre‑existing,
  stress‑aligned fracture network: a subset of fractures slip seismically to form the microearthquake cloud, while many more
  open or creep aseismically, linking into a vertically oriented plumbing system that governs the advance of the pressure front.

<section id="fractures">
  <h3>5) Fracture Networks, Stress, and Focal Mechanisms</h3>

  <p>
    So far we have treated the microearthquake cloud mainly as a set of distances from the injection well. But the <em>shape</em> of that
    cloud in three dimensions, and how it relates to the fractures and stresses in the rock, is just as revealing. When we plot the
    epicentres in map view, colour‑coded by time, they fill out an elongated ellipse around the injection point. Most events sit
    neatly inside this envelope; only a few outliers to the northwest poke beyond it, perhaps hinting at local channels or
    patches that were already close to failure before injection began. In cross‑section, the picture becomes even clearer: the
    microseismicity forms a vertically stretched ellipsoid, much taller than it is wide. This echoes what we saw in the flow
    analysis – the reservoir is far from isotropic, and vertical connectivity is especially strong.
  </p>

  <p>
    Downhole image logs and core data tell us that this cloud of seismicity is not forming in a featureless block of granite.
    Instead, it is threading its way through a pre‑existing joint network. Two main families of steeply dipping joints dominate:
    a NW–SE trending set (Set 1), and an orthogonal NE–SW set (Set 2). Independent hydraulic tests and mining data show that
    the present‑day maximum horizontal stress, σ<sub>H</sub>, also trends roughly NW–SE – almost exactly along the major horizontal
    axis of the seismic ellipse. In other words, the direction in which seismicity spreads most easily on the horizontal plane is
    the same direction in which the rock is being squeezed the hardest, and the same direction picked out by one of the main
    joint sets. This alignment is a strong clue that we are seeing the stress field and the fracture architecture working together
    to guide both flow and failure.

        dominant joint set. Only a few outliers lie beyond the envelope, hinting at possible fluid channels or particularly
        sensitive patches.

  <p>
    When we look at vertical cross‑sections, the vertical extent of activity really stands out. The induced earthquakes occupy a
    tall, column‑like volume extending hundreds of metres above and below the injection depth. This reinforces the idea from the
    diffusivity analysis that a highly permeable vertical structure – or a bundle of structures – is being activated. The
    combination of horizontally aligned maximum stress and vertically dominant permeability suggests a “ladder” geometry: stress
    controls which subvertical joints are primed for slip, while vertical connections allow pressure to migrate up and down far
    more readily than sideways.

        Most focal mechanisms are strike‑slip, with a smaller number showing normal‑faulting components. The preferred

        pre‑existing fractures rather than the creation of entirely new faults.

  <p>
    Source mechanism analysis – the “beach ball” diagrams familiar from earthquake bulletins – adds another layer of evidence.
    By stacking and inverting waveforms from clusters of microearthquakes, we obtain composite focal mechanisms that describe
    the average fault orientation and slip style. At Rosemanowes, these solutions are predominantly double‑couple, strike‑slip
    types, with a lesser contribution from normal‑faulting events. The strike of the preferred slip planes tends to lie at an
    angle of about 20–40° to the maximum horizontal stress, exactly where Coulomb friction theory predicts shear reactivation
    should be easiest. Crucially, one nodal plane in the dominant mechanisms is subparallel to the NW–SE Set 1 joints, while the
    orthogonal Set 2 planes are more strongly clamped by the present‑day stress field. This points to slip occurring mainly on
    Set 1 fractures, with Set 2 joints playing more of a passive role as potential opening or linkage features.

      reservoir along its principal axes: plan view (x–y), and two vertical sections (x′–z and y′–z) aligned with the

      time and scaled by seismic moment, plotted relative to the injection point (yellow square) and the inclined injection well
      (red line). The bottom panel tracks cumulative injection, production, and net stored volume over the same time window.
      Together, these panels show how the seismic cloud expands into an elongated, vertically dominated ellipsoid while the
      reservoir progressively fills and the balance between injection and production shifts.

<p>
  The above vedio makes the 3‑D structure of the Rosemanowes reservoir much easier to see. As time advances, the coloured
  microearthquakes light up around the end of the injection well and then spread outwards, first near the wellbore and then
  along preferred directions picked out by the fracture network and stress field. In plan view, the cloud fills an elongated
  ellipse whose long axis aligns with the maximum horizontal stress and the dominant joint set. In cross‑section, the activity
  stretches vertically, revealing the tall, column‑like geometry of the stimulated volume. Meanwhile, the lower panel shows
  how injection, production, and net storage evolve in step with this growth: as more water is pumped in and only part of it is
  recovered, the reservoir inflates elastically, fractures open and creep, and the seismic cloud gradually maps out the portion
  of the rock mass that has been brought into hydraulic communication — much of it deforming almost silently.

<section id="mechanism">
  <h3>6) A Consistent Triggering Mechanism</h3>

  <p>
    By this point we’ve looked at the Rosemanowes experiment from several angles: how much fluid went in and out, how many
    earthquakes were triggered, how their sizes are distributed, and how the seismic cloud expands in 3‑D. The natural next
    question is: <em>what is the actual mechanism tying all of this together?</em> In other words, what is the rock doing at the
    fracture scale when we inject water?
  </p>

  <p>
    The source‑mechanism analysis – the “beach ball” diagrams built from clusters of microearthquakes – provides a crucial
    constraint. Most events have double‑couple, strike‑slip focal mechanisms, with a smaller number showing normal‑faulting
    components. The preferred slip planes are steeply dipping and oriented about 20–40° to the maximum horizontal stress,
    σ<sub>H</sub>, which is exactly the range where Coulomb friction theory predicts that shear reactivation is easiest. One of
    these nodal planes lines up with the NW–SE Set 1 joints identified in the borehole image logs, while the orthogonal Set 2
    joints carry higher normal stress and are less likely to slip in shear. This points strongly to the recorded microseismicity
    being generated by <strong>shear slip on optimally oriented pre‑existing Set 1 joints</strong>, not by entirely new fractures
    cutting through intact granite.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, several lines of evidence tell us that shear slip is only the tip of the iceberg. The strain partition
    factor, η, is around 10<sup>−4</sup>, meaning that only about 0.01% of the total deformation shows up as earthquakes. The
    volumetric strain implied by the net injected volume and the size of the seismic ellipsoid is on the order of 10<sup>−3</sup> –
    large enough that, in principle, a lot more seismic strain could have been released. Instead, most of the deformation is
    taken up aseismically: through elastic expansion of a very compliant fracture system, slow creep on fractures that never
    quite “let go” dynamically, and opening of tensile cracks that radiate little or no detectable seismic energy. As injection
    and circulation proceed, the apparent shear modulus drops in a step‑like fashion, and η decreases, indicating that the
    system becomes increasingly efficient at deforming silently rather than by generating additional microearthquakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conceptual model in the figure below pulls these threads together. In the present‑day stress field, the NW–SE Set 1
    joints are favourably oriented for shear, while the NE–SW Set 2 joints are more tightly clamped. When pore pressure
    increases along Set 1, the effective normal stress on those planes is reduced, promoting both seismic and aseismic shear
    slip. That slip has an important side effect: it tends to pull apart the orthogonal Set 2 joints in tension, especially where
    the two sets intersect. These opening segments act as <strong>tensile conduits</strong> – vertical and subvertical pathways that
    dramatically enhance permeability and allow fluid and pressure to move up and down much more easily than sideways.

        optimally oriented in the present‑day stress field (σ<sub>max</sub> ≈ σ<sub>H</sub>). Green segments represent tensile
        fractures opening parallel to σ<sub>max</sub>, often at intersections where shear on Set 1 pulls apart NE–SW‑striking
        Set 2 joints (black). This coupled shear‑and‑opening process creates vertically connected fluid pathways, explains the
        strong vertical permeability and anisotropic diffusion inferred from the seismic cloud, and accounts for why only a tiny
        fraction of the total deformation is radiated seismically.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>
    In this view, the induced seismicity at Rosemanowes is the audible part of a much larger deformation process. The earthquakes
    we record come mainly from shear reactivation of a specific family of steep joints (Set 1), which are optimally oriented in
    the in‑situ stress field. Their slip, both seismic and aseismic, helps to pry open the intersecting Set 2 joints and other
    tensile cracks, stitching together a vertically oriented, high‑permeability network. This network can store large volumes of
    injected fluid, transmit pressure efficiently, and deform in a predominantly aseismic way. The result is a reservoir that
    looks highly active in terms of fluid movement and strain, but relatively quiet in terms of felt seismicity – a key insight
    for understanding and managing the risks of geothermal stimulation in similar fractured crystalline rocks.
  </p>
</section>





<section id="implications">
  <h3>7) Implications for Geothermal Operations and Risk</h3>

  <p>
    Rosemanowes offers a useful reminder that “more fluid” does not automatically mean “more earthquakes”. The reservoir
    experienced substantial deformation – volumetric strains on the order of 10<sup>−3</sup> – yet only about 0.01% of that strain was
    released seismically. Most of the work went into elastic expansion, aseismic slip, and tensile opening of fractures. In other
    words, a jointed, compliant granite can quietly absorb a great deal of pressure and fluid without necessarily generating large
    or frequent felt events. For geothermal developers and regulators, this is both reassuring and challenging: reassuring because
    it shows that engineered reservoirs <em>can</em> deform largely silently, challenging because standard seismic monitoring only
    captures a very small fraction of what is actually happening underground.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Rosemanowes data also show that the seismic response can <em>decelerate</em> with time. As injection progressed and the
    circulation phase began, the apparent shear modulus and strain partition factor dropped in a step, suggesting that once a
    well‑connected fracture system was established, further pressurisation tended to be taken up more aseismically. The
    seismogenic index Σ is low and decreases with ongoing injection, again indicating a reservoir that becomes less seismically
    responsive per unit volume of water. At the same time, fluid flow clearly did not behave like simple, uniform diffusion:
    induced events mapped out a vertically elongated ellipsoid and a non‑Fickian triggering front, pointing to strong vertical
    channeling of flow through a fracture network aligned with the stress field. All of this underscores that the details of the
    fracture system and stress state matter at least as much as the raw injection volume.
  </p>

  <p>
    What does this mean in practice for managing induced seismicity at geothermal sites, in Cornwall and elsewhere? A few key
    lessons emerge:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Most deformation can be silent.</strong>
      Low strain partition factors (η) and a low seismogenic index (Σ) imply that large volumetric strain can accrue with only a
      small seismic footprint. Relying on microseismicity alone will underestimate how much the reservoir has actually deformed.
      Whenever possible, seismic monitoring should be combined with pressure, flow, and possibly geodetic data to get a fuller
      picture of reservoir response.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Expect anisotropic flow.</strong>
      Rosemanowes demonstrates that pre‑existing joint sets and the in‑situ stress field can focus flow into highly anisotropic
      patterns, with vertical permeability orders of magnitude higher than horizontal. In design and risk assessment, we should
      expect fluids to be funnelled preferentially along certain directions – particularly vertically – and not to spread out
      evenly in all directions. This has implications for where pressure fronts may reach critically stressed faults, and how far
      from the injection well seismicity might be triggered.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Seismic response can decelerate.</strong>
      The step‑like drop in apparent shear modulus with increasing net injected volume at Rosemanowes suggests that, in some
      reservoirs, the seismic response may be strongest early in stimulation and then weaken as a compliant fracture network
      becomes fully engaged. This is different from a “runaway” or near‑critical scenario often feared in public discussions.
      Operational strategies that allow time for the reservoir to adjust – staged injections, pauses, and careful ramp‑up of
      rates – may help encourage this kind of self‑buffering behaviour, though this will be site‑specific.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Monitoring priorities.</strong>
      The Rosemanowes case highlights how important it is to characterise the fracture system and stress field ahead of time.
      Joint‑set orientations, in‑situ stresses, and likely vertical connectivity should be core inputs to any induced‑seismicity
      risk assessment. Downhole imaging, stress testing, and early‑stage microseismic data can all be used to refine models of
      which fractures are most likely to slip seismically and where vertical channels might form. These models, in turn, should
      feed into real‑time traffic‑light systems for adjusting injection rates or temporarily shutting in wells if seismicity
      begins to concentrate in unfavourable locations or on critically stressed structures.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>


  <p>
    In summary, the Rosemanowes experiment shows that induced seismicity in HDR and EGS projects is not simply a matter of
    “how much water” but of <em>where</em> that water goes and <em>how</em> it interacts with the existing fracture fabric and
    stress field. Minimising induced seismicity means designing and operating reservoirs with these structural and mechanical
    subtleties in mind – aiming for fracture networks that carry most of the deformation aseismically, while watching closely for
    signs that pressure fronts are approaching large, well‑oriented faults that could respond more noisily.
