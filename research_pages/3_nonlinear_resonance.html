      <h2>Listening to Rocks Breathe: A View of Nonlinear Elasticity in Granular Solids</h2>

      <p>
        When we’re first taught elasticity, we usually meet Hooke’s law: double the stress, double the strain. 
        Springs behave nicely, waves pass through without changing shape, and everything stays linear and predictable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Real rocks don’t play by those rules.
        Sandstones, chalk, concrete, and crushed fault rocks are made of tiny grains and cracks (Figure&nbsp;1). 
        At their contacts, grains are constantly opening, closing, and slipping past each other as the rock is shaken or stressed. 
        At small vibrations they act almost linearly, but once we shake them a bit harder – at levels similar to strong seismic waves – 
        they start to show a very different, “nonlinear” personality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the last few decades, lab experiments have shown that granular rocks behave in surprisingly 
        complicated ways once we drive them hard enough with seismic‑like vibrations. 
        Their resonant frequencies shift as the drive increases, their stiffness can drop almost instantly when we change 
        the load, and then recover only very slowly. Their response also “remembers” what happened before: 
        it depends on the history of the deformation, not just what we are doing to the sample right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the simplest ways to see this is to put a rock sample in a resonance experiment, 
        turn up the shaking, and watch how its favourite vibration frequency moves.
        In a linear world, the resonance peak would simply get taller as we shake harder, but its frequency would stay put.
        In the lab, we see something else entirely (Figure&nbsp;2).
      </p>

            (Right) Resonance curves for Berea sandstone as the drive amplitude is increased.
            At low amplitudes, the peak is nearly symmetric and stays at the same frequency. 
            At higher amplitudes, the peak shifts, sharpens, and becomes asymmetric – a clear sign of nonlinear behaviour.

      <p>
        To dig deeper into this behaviour, laboratory researchers have combined two operations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Drive the rock in resonance</strong> to create controlled, relatively large strains, and</li>
        <li><strong>Probe its stiffness</strong> with small, high‑frequency waves while it is being shaken.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is what Dynamic Acousto‑Elastic Testing (DAET) and Nonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (NRUS) do:
             <ul>
        <li><strong>NRUS</strong>: track the resonance peak as drive increases.</li>
        <li><strong>DAET</strong>: monitor high‑frequency wave speed during low‑frequency pumping and recovery.</li>
           </ul>
        A low‑frequency source makes the sample ring in one of its resonant modes, while a high‑frequency ultrasonic 
        probe continuously measures how the wave speed – and therefore the stiffness – changes as the rock is stretched 
        and squeezed. The result is a kind of “stress–strain loop” for the wave speed, revealing conditioning, 
        hysteresis, and other fast nonlinear effects (Figure&nbsp;3).
      </p>

      <p>
        Another striking feature is that rocks can take a very long time to recover after being strongly shaken.
        If we “condition” a sample by driving it hard for a while, its seismic velocity drops.
        When we stop shaking, the velocity does not bounce back right away. Instead, it creeps back logarithmically 
        with time – fast at first, then slower and slower, over minutes to hours (Figure&nbsp;4).

      <p>
        This is not just a lab curiosity. At the scale of real faults and basins, the shallow crust shows 
        very similar behaviour after strong earthquakes. Immediately after a big event, seismic velocities in 
        the upper crust drop measurably; in the weeks to years that follow, they gradually climb back toward 
        their pre‑event values. Noise‑based monitoring of the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault is 
        a good example (Figure&nbsp;5).

    <section id="background">
      <h3>1) Why Rocks Don’t Obey Hooke’s Law</h3>

      <p>
        Hooke’s law says that stress is proportional to strain as long as deformations remain “small”. That works 
        well for many engineering materials, and it underpins most of exploration and global seismology: we model 
        seismic waves as small perturbations travelling through a linear elastic Earth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Granular solids – think sandstones, concrete, fault gouge, porous chalk – are different. They are made of 
        stiff mineral grains glued together by weaker material, riddled with microcracks, grain contacts, and bonds. 
        These internal defects are small (from nanometres up to microns) but numerous, and they dominate the 
        material’s compliance and attenuation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Experiments have shown that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nonlinearity kicks in at extremely small strains</strong>, sometimes as low as $ 10^{-7} $–$ 10^{-6} $, far below the threshold where you would expect classical lattice 
          anharmonicity to matter.
        </li>
        <li>
          The response is <strong>strongly asymmetric</strong>: compression and extension do not behave the same. 
          Compression can close cracks and increase stiffness; tension can open contacts and cause dramatic softening.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stress–strain relation shows <strong>hysteresis</strong> and <strong>memory</strong>: the path taken 
          (loading vs unloading) matters, and the material “remembers” past excursions.

      <h3>2) A Mathematical Playground: The Duffing Oscillator</h3>

      <p>
        Before tackling real rocks, a simpler nonlinear system – the Duffing oscillator – shows how <em>asymmetry</em> and <em>cliffs</em> can arise from strong softening alone:
      </p>

      <p>
        $ \ddot{x} + \phi \dot{x} + k x + \delta x^3 = A_r \sin(\omega t). $
      </p>

      <p>
        As $ | \delta | $ or $ A_r $ grows, the resonance peak shifts, tilts, and ultimately folds over to create a vertical “cliff” where tiny frequency changes trigger large amplitude jumps (a bifurcation).
      </p>

<!-- 3. Thermodynamic contact model -->
<section id="thermo-model">
  <h3>3) A Thermodynamic Picture: Fractures as Bistable Elements</h3>

  <p>
    We follow the Physical Review B model (Li, Sens‑Schönfelder &amp; Snieder, 2018): each microcontact/fracture is <em>bistable</em> (open or closed) with an energy barrier $ E_b $ between states. Thermal activation drives switching with Arrhenius rates:
  </p>

  <p>
    $$
    \tau_o = A \, e^{(E_b - E_o)/k_B T}, \quad \tau_c = A \, e^{(E_b - E_c)/k_B T}.
    $$
  </p>

  <p>
    For contacts with the same barrier energy, the fraction of open fractures $ n_o $ evolves as:
  </p>

  <p>
    $$
    \frac{d n_o}{dt} = - \frac{n_o}{\tau_o} + \frac{1 - n_o}{\tau_c}, \quad
    n_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\big[(E_o - E_c)/k_B T\big]}.
    $$
  </p>

  <p>
    The state energies depend <em>smoothly</em> on dynamic strain $ \\varepsilon $ via sigmoids (extension favors opening; compression favors closing):
  </p>

  <p>
    $$
    E_o(\varepsilon) = B_0 - \frac{A_1}{1 + \exp[-(\varepsilon - \mu)/\sigma]}, \quad
    E_c(\varepsilon) = A_0 + \frac{A_1}{1 + \exp[-(\varepsilon - \mu)/\sigma]}.
    $$
  </p>

  <p>
    We assume a uniform spectrum of barrier energies $ E_b \\in [E_{b,\\min}, E_{b,\\max}] $ to represent many time scales; the sample‑averaged open fraction is $ N_o(t) $ (average of $ n_o $ over $ E_b $). Stiffness then follows a linearized damage law:
  </p>

  <p>
    $$
    Y(t) = Y_0 - C_0 \big( N_o(t) - N_{\mathrm{ori}} \big).
    $$
  </p>

  <p>
    This closes a feedback loop: strain → energies → switching → $ N_o(t) $ → $ Y(t) $ → strain.

      <h3>4) Simulating Real Resonance Experiments</h3>

      <p>
        The PRB study reproduces the laboratory protocol step‑by‑step. A driven linear oscillator is coupled to the evolving modulus:
      </p>

      <p>
        $$ \\ddot{R}_A + 2 \\gamma \\dot{R}_A + \\Omega^2(t) R_A = A_r e^{-i \\omega t}, \\quad

      </p>

      <p>
        The measurable response is the acceleration amplitude $ \\omega^2 R_A L_0 $, after holding each frequency for a finite sweep interval $ \\Delta t $ to let $ N_o(t) $ and $ Y(t) $ evolve. The frequency is then stepped by $ \\Delta f $ up or down; the final state at one step is the initial state for the next.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key timescale is the maximum relaxation time $ \\tau_{\\max} $ (set by the slowest contacts):

      <h3>5) What the Model Reproduces: Slow Dynamics, Asymmetry, Hysteresis, and Cliffs</h3>

      <h4>5.1 Slow Dynamics: Log‑Time Recovery</h4>

      <p>
        After strong conditioning, the resonant frequency recovers approximately linearly with $ \\log t $ over decades in time, matching classic NRUS/DAET observations. This emerges from superposing many Arrhenius processes across $ E_b $; a single‑barrier case recovers roughly exponentially (no log‑time).

      <h4>5.2 Asymmetric Resonance Curves</h4>

      <p>
        Increasing drive opens more contacts near resonance, softens the sample, and shifts $ \\Omega $ downward while you are measuring it. This feedback steepens the left flank and flattens the right flank of the resonance peak—an asymmetry reproduced even without multi‑scale relaxation.

      <h4>5.3 Up–Down Differences and Sweep‑Rate Dependence</h4>

      <p>
        With <em>weak to moderate</em> nonlinearity, the up–down difference is a memory effect from slow dynamics: it vanishes when $ \\Delta t \\gtrsim \\tau_{\\max} $ (slow sweeps).
      </p>

      </div>

      <h4>5.4 Cliffs and Bifurcations in Strongly Nonlinear Regimes</h4>

      <p>
        Increase the damage sensitivity $ C_0 $ or the drive and the resonance curve folds, creating a vertical “cliff”. In this regime, two <em>stable</em> equilibrium states can coexist at the same frequency; the system follows one branch until it reaches a turning point and then jumps—hence the persistent up–down difference right at the cliff, even for slow sweeps.

      <!-- <p>
        I tied many of these observations together into a single, thermodynamics‑based picture of what is happening inside granular solids when they are driven 
        nonlinearly. The goal was:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Can we explain, with one simple physical framework, the strange “nonclassical” elasticity of rocks – 
        including slow recovery, hysteresis, and even catastrophic jumps – that shows up in resonance experiments?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To get there, I combined two ingredients:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>mathematical nonlinear oscillator</strong> (the Duffing equation) that tells us how a driven,
          damped system with a nonlinear spring should respond.
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>thermodynamics‑based contact model</strong> that treats the rock’s internal defects – microcracks,
          grain contacts, chemical bonds, capillary bridges – as tiny bistable elements that can be open or closed 
          and can switch state through thermal activation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By coupling these two, and by explicitly mimicking the way laboratory resonance experiments are actually 
        run, we were able to reproduce a wide range of puzzling experimental features in a single framework. 
      </p> -->

    <!-- <div class="callout" style="border-left:4px solid #555;padding:.75rem 1rem;background:#f9f9fb;margin:1.25rem 0;">
        <strong>At a glance — what the unified model explains</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Log‑time recovery of resonant frequency after shaking stops (slow dynamics).</li>
          <li>Asymmetric resonance curves that steepen to the left and flatten to the right as drive increases.</li>
          <li>Up–down differences that vanish for slow sweeps when nonlinearity is weak.</li>
          <li>“Cliffs” (vertical segments) and persistent up–down differences from a <em>bifurcation</em> when nonlinearity is strong.</li>
        </ul>

        By treating each grain contact as a tiny nonlinear oscillator with its own 
        internal “state” (representing things like contact stiffness or damage), and then coupling many of these 
        oscillators together, we can explain a wide range of observations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>resonance peaks that shift and skew as we turn up the drive,</li>
        <li>instantaneous softening when we change the applied stress,</li>
        <li>slow, logarithmic recovery of seismic velocities after strong shaking, and</li>
        <li>hysteresis and memory effects in both lab samples and the shallow crust.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In future posts, I’ll walk through how this contact‑based picture connects to the experiments above and 
        how it can be used to interpret field observations like those from Parkfield.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mesoscopic contacts and fractures dominate nonlinearity</strong> at microstrain levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Log‑time recovery</strong> reflects a broad spectrum of activation energies and time scales.</li>
        <li><strong>Cliffs</strong> are the observable signature of a <em>bifurcation</em> in the coupled contact–oscillator system.</li>
        <li><strong>Field‑scale transients</strong> (post‑seismic or injection‑induced) are consistent with the same physics.</li>
