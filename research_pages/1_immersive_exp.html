      <h2>Immersive Wave Experimentation (IWE): Cloaking, Holography, and Cloning</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you have ever clapped in a small room or dropped a pebble in a bucket, you know the problem: waves bounce off the boundaries. In a real ocean, a quiet field, or outer space, waves can radiate away seemingly “to infinity.” In a lab, they hit walls and come right back. Those echoes contaminate measurements, shrink the space where we can trust the results, and make it hard to study how waves actually behave in the wild.
      </p>

      <p>
        We decided not to fight that limitation with bigger rooms or thicker foam. Instead, we taught the walls to help. Our approach blends a physical experiment with a virtual world in real time. We call this Immersive Boundary Conditions (IBCs). Think of it as a portal: the lab stays small, but the waves inside it “believe” they are in an unbounded environment because the boundaries actively behave as if the outside extends forever. 
        IBC let us switch off a lab’s walls, make objects acoustically invisible, project virtual objects into reality, and even clone the scattering fingerprint of anything we like—on demand and across a broad range of frequencies.

            This is a versatile acoustic research facility where experiments at kHz frequencies are performed in compact, 
            reflective spaces. For example, a 2D “sandwich” waveguide is used to simulate layered media and study broadband acoustic propagation, 
            while a large water tank (measuring 3.1 × 4.5 × 2.7 m) serves as a quasi–3D environment 
            for immersive experiments that bridge the frequency gap between laboratory and field scales. 
            In addition, a state‐of‐the‐art LDV robot is employed to scan rock cubes, enabling precise elastic wave measurements at the surfaces of solid media. 
            Together, these setups exemplify how ETH WaveLab uses Immersive Boundary Conditions (IBCs) and Multidimensional Deconvolution (MDD) to 
            virtually remove lab boundaries, thereby canceling unwanted reflections, rendering objects invisible (cloaking), projecting virtual scatterers (holography),
            and even cloning full broadband scattering responses on demand.

      <h3>1) The challenge: small labs, bouncing waves</h3>

      <p>
       In the wild—open water, the sky, or space—waves radiate away and their energy leaves the scene, but in tanks, rooms, and waveguides they ricochet off walls,
        polluting measurements and burying subtle effects like weak scattering or fine phase shifts. Anechoic chambers try to tame those echoes with foam wedges, 
        yet their effectiveness collapses at low frequency because the wedge depth must scale with wavelength, 
        making low‑kHz setups impractically large; in solid 3D volumes for full elastic P–S studies, operating around 1–20 kHz means wavelengths approach
         the sample size, so boundary energy can dominate the interior wavefield. Reduced‑size labs (kHz acoustics, plates, rooms, waveguides)
          thus suffer reflections that mask the very scattering we want to observe; passive absorbers are bulky and narrowband, 
          while classic active cancellation degrades off‑axis and at higher frequencies. This is compounded by a scale gap: seismology and many field scenarios live
           below ~100 Hz, whereas conventional lab acoustics often push to hundreds of kHz or MHz to keep echoes at bay, making it hard to transfer 
           insights—especially for frequency‑dependent phenomena like attenuation, dispersion, anisotropy, and nonlinearity that do not upscale reliably.

    <h3>2) Immersive Boundary Conditions: Active wave energy cancellation</h3>

    <p>
      In size-limited laboratories, reflections from rigid boundaries often obscure the waves scattered by interior objects.
      One elegant solution is the deployment of active sources around the physical experimental domain.
      In an ideal implementation, the active boundary sources generate counter-waves that completely cancel the outgoing wavefield.
      As a result, the only waves visible in the experiment are those related to the interior scatterers, free from unwanted
      boundary effects. This clear separation is crucial for accurate measurement and analysis. Also, in this way,
       the experiment is virtually "immersed" into a much larger space where the propagation characteristics are as if no rigid boundaries were present. 
       In effect, the physical wave propagation mirrors the behavior of waves in an idealized, boundary-free environment.

      <p>
        The active sources can create a virtual environment by emitting waves designed not only to cancel naturally outgoing waves through carefully controlled emissions,
         but also to actively represent interactions between a physical experiment and an artificial virtual domain. In this configuration, the physical wave propagation 
         experiment becomes seamlessly connected to an extended or virtual environment—the emitted waves embodying the desired properties of an unbounded, 
         immersive domain while the propagating waves remain explicit in the physical realm.

            <strong>Immersive Wave Experimentation Concept</strong><br>
            By employing active sources to both cancel outgoing waves and emit tailored waves, we simulate an unbounded or extended experimental domain. This setup enables the representation of interactions between the physical and virtual environments, allowing for an accurate study of wave propagation and scattering phenomena as if the laboratory boundaries were non-existent.

        </figure>
      </div>

<p>
  Simulation movies of this approach strikingly illustrate that, with active cancellation, the laboratory’s confined physical space transforms
   into an immersive experimental domain. This environment faithfully replicates real-world scattering phenomena and supports broadband measurements without
    the distortions typically caused by reflections.

  <h3>3) Immersive Boundary Conditions (IBCs): Real-time, broadband acoustic implementation</h3>
  <p>
    IBCs let us virtually replace what lies beyond a control surface by extrapolating measurements from an outer recording ring to an inner emitting ring in real time. 
    In our implementation, pressure and particle velocity measured on a closed outer surface are used to predict the incident wave field on the inner boundary using
     representation theorems together with precomputed Green’s functions as “wave kernels” to extrapolate the field. This approach provides deterministic,
      broadband, and global control at low latency, independent of frequency or incident angle. With low-latency FPGAs (no more than 200 μs compute time), the extrapolated wave field is immediately re-injected into the lab so that waves cross seamlessly between the physical 
      and virtual domains. This real-time prediction method cancels unwanted boundary reflections, enabling complex effects such as cloaking and holography without
       any prior knowledge of the incident wave.

  <h3>4) Cloaking: Perfect invisibility at all angles without prior source knowledge</h3>

<p>
  Think Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak: light bends around him and no one sees a thing. Doing that for light in open space is
  famously hard—an optical cloak would need to steer every color and every angle around an object and still deliver the wavefront to
  the observer “on time.” Passive materials run into causality and dispersion limits, so practical optical cloaks tend to be
  narrowband, angle/polarization‑limited, or confined to special geometries.
</p>

<p>
  For sound, we take a different route: instead of hiding the object, we hide its acoustic signature. Using interior boundary control
  (IBC), an outer ring of microphones listens and a real‑time extrapolation predicts the wavefield at an inner ring of loudspeakers.
  Those speakers emit a secondary field that cancels the object’s scattering—including multipath from the lab boundaries—without any
  prior model of the incident sound. Even moving or unknown sources can be cloaked.

  What does “invisible” look like in practice? We cloaked a quasi‑rigid circular scatterer (diameter 12.6 cm) inside a 2D waveguide by surrounding it with 20 control 
  loudspeakers. A moving broadband primary field was synthesized by eight sources along a 96° arc. With the cloak off, both back‑ and forward‑scattering are visible;
   with the cloak on, the measured total field matches the “no‑object” reference—even at later times when wall echoes dominate. Finite‑element simulations closely 
   reproduce the measurements. Across ~3.5 octaves (up to ~8.7 kHz), the mean scattered intensity at the outer array is reduced by about −8.4 dB and the angular 
   scattering pattern is uniformly suppressed, demonstrating all‑angle, source‑agnostic cloaking.

      <ol>
        <li>
          Acquire: illuminate a real scatterer placed inside a closed receiver aperture and use MDD to retrieve its scattering Green’s

        </li>
        <li>
          Replay: remove the object; use immersive holography to extrapolate from the outer ring to the inner ring and drive the sources
          so that the lab field scatters exactly as if the object were present — for any incident broadband wavefield, all orders included.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Because the twin is digital, we can augment it: translate/rotate it, scale its response, or even add non-physical gain/transparency.
